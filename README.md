# 🛡️ Jave Ethical Defender (Public)

**The firewall that thinks.**  
Jave Ethical Defender is a next-generation AI-powered Layer 7 firewall that defends against modern threats through behavioral analysis—not static rules.

This is the public documentation portal for the project. The source code for Jave’s core engine is not included here, but fully operational demos and technical insights are available below.

## 🚀 Why Jave?

Traditional firewalls react to known patterns. Jave detects **intent**.

- **Deterministic AI scoring** of every inbound connection
- **Entropy mapping** and anomaly profiling
- **Honeypot containerization** for behavioral analysis
- **Scraper, botnet, and payload detection** in real time
- Ultra-low resource usage even under live attacks

Already tested against a 5,000+ node botnet.  
Average CPU load: under 10%.  
Detection success: 100%.  
Fail2Ban? Didn’t catch a single one.
