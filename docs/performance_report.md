# 📊 Performance Report: Jave Ethical Defender

Jave Ethical Defender is not theoretical software—it has already been stress-tested in live environments and has outperformed traditional tools in every major category: detection rate, resource usage, and response precision.

This report outlines the results of key benchmarks, real-world attack simulations, and comparative analysis with legacy firewalls.

## 🧪 Botnet Test Scenario

**Attack Profile:**
- **Type:** Multi-IP botnet credential brute-force
- **Node Count:** 5,000+
- **Origin Score:** 100/100 (via AbuseIPDB)
- **Tactics:** IP rotation, CLi injection attempts, entropy flooding

**Host Conditions:**
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7950X3D, 2GB RAM
- **Disk IO:** Capped to 1MB/s
- **Firewall Baseline:** Hetzner (none), Ubuntu UFW (disabled), Fail2Ban (enabled, for comparison)

**Results:**
- **Fail2Ban:** Did not detect or ban a single IP.
- **Jave:** Detected all threats based on behavior:
  - Malformed headers
  - Entropy surge patterns
  - Packet rhythm anomalies
- All offending IPs were sandboxed, then banned.

---

## 🔍 Efficiency and Load Metrics

- **CPU Load:** Peaked at 8.5% during peak botnet activity
- **RAM Usage:** Held under 210MB consistently
- **Disk I/O:** Maintained smooth logging without latency
- **Logging Output:** Full forensic archive including:
  - IP profiles
  - Packet history
  - Offense tags
  - Trust score deltas

---

## 🧠 Notable Advantages

- **Deterministic Defense:** Jave doesn’t wait for a rule match—it predicts intent.
- **Rotating IP Detection:** Flagged even legitimate tools like VS Code Copilot for acting bot-like.
- **Honeypot Isolation:** Kept attackers occupied with fake 200 OK responses, wasting their compute while protecting system integrity.

## 📦 Next Steps

- Independent 3rd-party validation (in planning)
- Public-facing sandbox demo (coming soon)
- User-controlled telemetry report mode (via CLI flag)

> _Jave doesn't just block threats. It exhausts them, exposes them, and educates developers on how to do better._
