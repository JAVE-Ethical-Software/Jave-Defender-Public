# 🛠 Usage Guide: Jave Ethical Defender

Welcome to Jave Ethical Defender—a next-gen AI firewall designed to be fast, intuitive, and devastatingly effective against modern web threats.

While this public repository doesn't include the source code of Jave's core engine (to prevent misuse and IP theft), it **does** give you everything you need to understand how Jave operates, what it requires, and how it can be deployed in your environment.

---

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Debian, Ubuntu preferred)
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core (ARM64 or x86_64 recommended)
- **RAM**: 512MB–2GB (depending on logging and concurrency)
- **Disk I/O**: 1MB/s minimum recommended for forensic log throughput
- **Network Interface**: Full access to ingress/egress preferred

Jave is tested and optimized for AMD Ryzen 7950X3D-class hardware, but scales down beautifully.

## 🧩 Core Components (Description Only)

- **Jave Proxy** (Layer 7 Reverse Proxy)
- **Header & Packet Analyzer**
- **Daemon Scorer** (Trust Map and Behavioral Delta Engine)
- **Entropy Profiler**
- **Honeypot Orchestrator**
- **System Watchdog & Logging Hub**

---

## 📦 Deployment Overview (Conceptual)

Here's how a typical deployment might look:
[Internet] ↓ [Port 80/443] → [Jave Proxy (Port 8080)] ↓ [Packet Analyzer & Trust Engine] ↓ [App / Web Server]

Traffic enters via standard HTTP/HTTPS, is redirected to Jave's proxy, undergoes inspection, and is routed accordingly:
- **Trusted connections** pass through.
- **Suspicious traffic** is sandboxed or delayed.
- **Malicious traffic** is quarantined or banned entirely.

---

## 🧪 Sample Config

Check out `jave-config-sample.toml` for a look at how configuration might work:

- `sensitivity = 0.75`
- `honeypot_enabled = true`
- `entropy_quarantine_threshold = 0.85`
- `default_ip_score = 0.6`

These values simulate how operators can tune Jave for low-traffic blogs, high-volume APIs, or enterprise workloads.
